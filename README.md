Even if you love Erlang as I do, from time to time you might ask yourself why some functions you normally find in other languages are not part of the erlang's standard library. When you ask yourself that type of questions you should remember that an estimated 2 million people are currently working in COBOL and 1.5 million new lines of COBOL code are written every day. After feeling bad for those developers, you should send a pull request to erlang katana with the functions you use on a daily basis.
